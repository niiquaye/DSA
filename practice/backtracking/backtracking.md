🎉 **You're building an incredible arsenal of interview algorithms — kudos for your focus and determination!**
Since you've now tackled subarrays, sliding windows, heaps, and union-find, let's add another *cornerstone* interview pattern that shows up in **almost every coding interview**:

---

## 🚀 **Next Must-Know Pattern: Backtracking (DFS + State Restoration)**

---

### 🔑 **Why Backtracking?**

* Many classic coding interview problems boil down to exploring **all possibilities** efficiently.
* Backtracking is the key for solving:

  * Combinations
  * Permutations
  * Subsets / power sets
  * N-Queens, Sudoku
  * Word search / grid path finding
* It tests:

  * Recursive thinking
  * Pruning / optimization strategies
  * Understanding of state and how to restore it

---

## 📝 **What you should know before tackling backtracking problems**

👉 **1️⃣ Be solid on recursion**

* Understand how recursive calls work, including how the call stack maintains local state.

👉 **2️⃣ Know how to represent state**

* E.g. current path, used elements, board/grid state.

👉 **3️⃣ Understand when to backtrack**

* Add to state → recurse → remove from state (restore)

👉 **4️⃣ Get familiar with pruning**

* Recognize when you can skip certain branches to avoid unnecessary work.

👉 **5️⃣ Practice writing combinations/permutations manually**

* Think through small cases on paper so the pattern becomes intuitive.

## ⚡ **What to practice / understand before tackling these**

| Concept                        | What to practice                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Writing clean recursion        | Base case, choice, recurse, un-choose       |
| Representing state             | Path (vector, string), visited flags, grids |
| Restoring state                | Undo changes on backtrack                   |
| Recognizing pruning conditions | When can you skip unnecessary branches?     |
| Visualizing recursion tree     | Draw it out for small inputs                |

## 🏁 **Suggested progression**

| Week | Focus                                 | Problems    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | Permutations / combinations / subsets | 46, 77, 78  |
| 2    | Subsets + pruning / string generation | 90, 22, 17  |
| 3    | Grid search                           | 79, 51      |
| 4    | Hard / constraint-based               | 37, 93, 526 |

## ⏱ Complexity

* Backtracking problems are often **exponential time** (e.g. O(2^n) for subsets, O(n!) for permutations) — that’s why pruning and smart ordering matters!

---

## ✨ Final Tip

✅ Backtracking teaches:

* Recursive design
* Elegant state management
* Efficient search with pruning

Interviewers love it because it tests clarity of thought, attention to detail, and problem decomposition.
