🔥 **I love that you want to master monotonic stack techniques! This is an essential tool for competitive programming and interviews. Let’s go over some classic and powerful problems where monotonic stacks shine.**

## 🌟 **Top problems to practice monotonic stack**

---

### 1️⃣ **Trapping Rain Water (LeetCode 42)**

✅ What you just solved — practice both stack and two-pointer versions.

👉 Learn:

* How to find boundaries for water
* How to handle pop / bounded area logic

---

### 2️⃣ **Largest Rectangle in Histogram (LeetCode 84)**

👉 Given bar heights, find the largest rectangle that fits inside the histogram.

👉 Learn:

* How to find nearest smaller to left/right using stack
* How to compute area for each bar as height of rectangle

📝 Example:

```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Maximal Rectangle (LeetCode 85)**

👉 2D version of largest rectangle: find largest rectangle of 1s in a binary matrix.

👉 Learn:

* How to extend histogram logic row-by-row

📝 Example:

```
Input: matrix = [
 ["1","0","1","0","0"],
 ["1","0","1","1","1"],
 ["1","1","1","1","1"],
 ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Next Greater Element (I/II/III) (LeetCode 496 / 503 / 556)**

👉 For each element, find the next greater (or smaller) element in array (circular or not).

👉 Learn:

* How to process array forwards or backwards
* How to use stack to remember candidates

📝 Example:

```
Input: [4,5,2,10,8]
Next greater: [5,10,10,-1,-1]
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Daily Temperatures (LeetCode 739)**

👉 For each day, how many days do you wait for a warmer temperature?

👉 Learn:

* How to track index gaps using stack

📝 Example:

```
Input: [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

---

### 6️⃣ **Sum of Subarray Minimums (LeetCode 907)**

👉 For each subarray, find min element → sum all mins.

👉 Learn:

* How to find contribution of each element as min using monotonic stack

📝 Example:

```
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: 17
```

---

### 7️⃣ **Remove K Digits (LeetCode 402)**

👉 Remove `k` digits to make smallest number.

👉 Learn:

* Monotonic increasing stack for greedy removal

📝 Example:

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
```

---

## 🚀 **Why these?**

✅ Cover increasing/decreasing stacks
✅ Cover left/right boundary problems
✅ Cover contribution counting (e.g. sum of mins)
✅ Cover both greedy and geometric applications

---

## 🌟 **Recommended order to practice**

1️⃣ Next Greater Element I/II
2️⃣ Daily Temperatures
3️⃣ Largest Rectangle in Histogram
4️⃣ Trapping Rain Water (revisit)
5️⃣ Remove K Digits
6️⃣ Sum of Subarray Minimums
7️⃣ Maximal Rectangle
