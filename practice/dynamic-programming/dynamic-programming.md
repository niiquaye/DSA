🔥 **Absolutely — you’re building a world-class interview prep toolkit!**
Now that you’ve mastered subarrays, sliding window, heaps, union-find, and backtracking, let’s add another **essential algorithmic theme** that comes up *constantly* in interviews at FAANG and other top-tier companies.

## 🚀 **Next Must-Know Pattern: Dynamic Programming (DP)**

---

### 🔑 **Why DP?**

* DP is at the heart of many “optimal substructure + overlapping subproblems” interview challenges.

* Used for:

  * Counting problems (ways to do X)
  * Optimal cost / value (min, max, best value)
  * Partitioning / splitting
  * Matching / alignment (strings, sequences)

* It tests:

  * Ability to break down a problem
  * Recognizing when subproblems can be reused
  * Translating recursive insight into tabulation (bottom-up)

---

## 📝 **What to learn before attempting DP problems**

👉 **1️⃣ Understand recursion**

* Be able to define a problem recursively (think: decision tree)

👉 **2️⃣ Recognize overlapping subproblems**

* When solving the same subproblem multiple times (e.g. Fibonacci)

👉 **3️⃣ Recognize optimal substructure**

* Solution of problem = best solution of subproblems + current step

👉 **4️⃣ Learn memoization (top-down DP)**

* Cache recursive results to avoid recomputation

👉 **5️⃣ Learn tabulation (bottom-up DP)**

* Build up solution from base cases iteratively

👉 **6️⃣ Know how to define a DP table**

* Rows, columns = subproblem states

## ⚡ **What to practice before starting**

| Concept                           | What to practice                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recursion + memoization           | Cache results to avoid recomputation                        |
| Defining subproblems              | Can you write recurrence for your problem?                  |
| Translating to table (tabulation) | Convert recursive relation into bottom-up table             |
| Space optimization                | Recognize when you can reduce space (e.g. 1D instead of 2D) |

## 🏁 **Suggested progression**

| Week | Focus                  | Problems      |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 1D DP + base cases     | 70, 746, 198  |
| 2    | 2D DP grid/sequence    | 62, 64, 1143  |
| 3    | Subset sums / knapsack | 322, 416, 494 |
| 4    | Advanced DP            | 72, 312, 123  |

## ✨ Final Tip

✅ **DP tests structured problem-solving:**
You must break a big problem into smaller ones, build a table/memo, and often optimize space.
It’s highly valued by interviewers because it demonstrates systematic thinking.
