## 🚀 **Next Must-Know Pattern: Graph Algorithms (BFS / DFS / Topological Sort)**

---

### 🔑 **Why Graph Algorithms?**

* Many real-world problems are naturally modeled as graphs: networks, dependencies, paths, cycles, islands.
* Interviewers love graph problems because they:

  * Test abstract thinking (modeling real-world into nodes/edges)
  * Test traversal techniques (BFS/DFS)
  * Test cycle detection, shortest paths, topological order

---

## 📝 **What to know before tackling graph problems**

👉 **1️⃣ Graph representations**

* Adjacency list (most common for sparse graphs)
* Adjacency matrix
* Edge list

👉 **2️⃣ Understand BFS and DFS**

* When and why to use each
* BFS = level-order (good for shortest path in unweighted graphs)
* DFS = deep exploration (good for cycle detection, connectivity)

👉 **3️⃣ Know when to use topological sort**

* For problems with dependencies (DAGs — directed acyclic graphs)

👉 **4️⃣ Recognize cycles / components**

* Practice detecting cycles, counting components

👉 **5️⃣ Know weighted graph basics**

* Dijkstra’s for shortest path with weights (optional extension)
